# Beginner Projects

The objective of this repository is to be used as a collection of projects that someone new to programming could use for reference. I hope to add more languages than just Python, but for now that's all I have. I'll try to make a simple and advanced version of each project, but chances are some will just have one version. Also note that while multiple projects may have a simple and advanced version, the simple version of one may be more complicated than the advanced version of another. This is simply due to the fact that projects like the game of Battleship is more complicated to program than Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Python

### Tic-Tac-Toe

There are two files in this directory: `TicTacToeSimple.py` and `TicTacToeAdvanced.py`. Both do exactly the same thing: let the user play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. New programmers should look at both.

### Factor Finder

Gets an integer from the user, then prints out the factors of that number in ascending order

### Python Documentation

It's good practice to document your code, even though I usually don't too good of a job. I recommend reading through [this page](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/#documenting-your-python-code-base-using-docstrings). I personally like the Google docstring format (and I used it when documenting these programs), but all of them have pros and cons. A complete Google docstrings guide can be found [here](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings). In-code documentation can also be found by calling `help(THING_YOU_NEED_HELP_WITH)`
